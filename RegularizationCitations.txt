The concept of regularization is quite old in the elds of statistics and
machine learning. Early results on the topic of regularization include the
articles of Tichonov on the inverse and ill-conditioned problems [136], [137],
[138] (Tikhonov papers). The Tichonov regularization is also known under the term ridge regression
in the eld of statistics [68], [66] - ridge regression, [65] while the Lasso regularization
method [135] (Tibshirani) was also introduced two decades ago.
The last 7 seven years the concept of regularization has been introduced
in the eld of system identication in order to tackle the problem of high
noise sensitivity in the linear nonparametric modeling case [109] (Pillonetto), [32], [84],
[111], [110], [46], [77].
